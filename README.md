# Stock-and-Crypto-News-Sentimental-Analysis

There’s so much news and research out there on financial markets that it can be hard to keep up. But what if you could automate some of that research using Python. 

That’s exactly what this project does

1. Scrape stock and crypto news from the web using Python and BeautifulSoup
2. Automatically summarize financial news with Deep Learning using a fine-tuned Hugging Face Pegasus Transformers model
3. Calculate sentiment for various stocks and cryptos using a pre-trained Transformers deep learning pipeline
